## Usage

First things first, this bot is rather unstable, meaning it has only been tested on Windows, with my internet conection _etc... etc..._. If you encounter any issues, or have any suggestions, feel free to let me know or contribute yourself.

## Usage

In the desired folder, clone this repository:

    > git clone https://github.com/markmelnic/Reddit-Bot

Install the dependencies:

    > pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the latest chromedriver here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and extract `chromedriver.exe` in the same directory as this script.

### Using command line arguments

    > py main.py -h

Available flags:

    -h, --help:
        Show this help message and exit.

    -l, --links:
        [path] File containing liks and actions. The file should be a list of links, one per line, following the structure: url|action|comment (if action is comment). Actions can be one of the following: upvote, downvote, comment, join, leave. The file should be in the same directory as this script.

    -a, --accounts:
        [path] File containing credentials for accounts to perform the actions with. The file should be a list of usernames and passwords, one per line, following the structure: username|password. The file should be in the same directory as this script.

#### Examples:

This will downvote the first post, downvote the second one and comment under it, join "r/ProgrammerHumor" community then leave it.

    > py main.py --accounts accounts.txt --links posts.txt

where accounts.txt looks like this:

    testuser1|testpass1
    testuser2|testpass2

and posts.txt looks like this:
